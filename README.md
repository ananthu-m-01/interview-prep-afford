# interview-prep-afford

A curated collection of frontend and backend interview prep code snippets, projects, and learning exercises.

This repository serves as my personal playground to explore important programming concepts and patterns often asked in interviews. Each folder contains a focused topic with clean and commented code examples.

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned

### 🔄 Debounce

The debounce technique helps optimize performance by limiting how often a function (like an API call) is triggered. For example, in a search bar, debounce waits for the user to stop typing before making the API request — reducing unnecessary network traffic.

- 🛠 Implemented using lodash.debounce
- 🎯 Used React useState, useEffect, and useCallback
- 📁 Structured with separate dummy API and data files
